Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. 
Heart of debugging lies in understanding the bugs and deciding on the tools for debugging.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file main.h is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file 0-main.c tests for a postitive_or_negative() function.

The file 1-main.c comments out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

The file 2-largest_number.c correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

The file 3-print_remaining_days.c converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
