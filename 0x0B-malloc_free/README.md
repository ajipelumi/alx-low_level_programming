**Dynamic Memory Allocation** can be defined as a procedure in which the size of a data structure (like Array) is changed during the runtime.
C provides some functions to achieve these tasks. 

There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under <stdlib.h> header file to facilitate dynamic memory allocation in C programming. One of them is **malloc**

The *malloc* or *memory allocation* method in C is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size. It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form. It doesnâ€™t Initialize memory at execution time so that it has initialized each block with the default garbage value initially. If space is insufficient, allocation fails and returns a NULL pointer.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file main.h is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file _putchar.c is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file 0-create_array.c is a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

The file 1-strdup.c is a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

The file 2-str_concat.c is a function that concatenates two strings.

The file 3-alloc_grid.c is a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

The file 4-free_grid.c is a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

The file 100-argstostr.c is a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
