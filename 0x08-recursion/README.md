The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.

A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems. Many more recursive calls can be generated as and when required.

#### Properties of Recursion:
- Performing the same operations multiple times with different inputs.
- In every step, we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
- Base condition is needed to stop the recursion otherwise infinite loop will occur.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file main.h is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file _putchar.c is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file 0-puts_recursion.c is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

The file 1-print_rev_recursion.c is a function that prints a string in reverse.

The file 2-strlen_recursion.c is a function that returns the length of a string.

The file 3-factorial.c is a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

The file 4-pow_recursion.c is a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

The file 5-sqrt_recursion.c is a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

The file 6-is_prime_number.c is a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

The file 100-is_palindrome.c is a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
