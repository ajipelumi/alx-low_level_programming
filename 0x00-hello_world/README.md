A compiler translates the code written in one language to some other language without changing the meaning of the program. 
The compiler makes the target code efficient and optimized in terms of time and space. 
The compilation process can be divided into four steps: Pre-processing, Compiling, Assembling, and Linking.

This README decribes what each script and program is doing;

The file 0-preprocessor is a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

The file 1-compiler is a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

The file 2-assembler is a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

The file 3-name is a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

The file 4-puts.c is a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

The file 5-printf.c is a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.

The file 6-size.c is a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

The file 100-intel is a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

The file 101-quote.c is a C program "that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
