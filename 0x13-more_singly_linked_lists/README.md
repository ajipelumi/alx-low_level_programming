A _linked list_ is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

##

In simple words, a _linked list_ consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file `lists.h` is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file `_putchar.c` is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file `0-print_listint.c` is a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.

The file `1-listint_len.c` is a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.

The file `2-add_nodeint.c` is a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.

The file `3-add_nodeint_end.c` is a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.

The file `4-free_listint.c` is a function that frees a listint_t list.

The file `5-free_listint2.c` is a function that frees a listint_t list.

The file `6-pop_listint.c` is a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).

The file `7-get_nodeint.c` is a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.

The file `8-sum_listint.c` is a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.

The file `9-insert_nodeint.c` is a function that inserts a new node at a given position.

The file `10-delete_nodeint.c` is a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
