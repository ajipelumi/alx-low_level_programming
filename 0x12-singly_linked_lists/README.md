A _linked list_ is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:

##

In simple words, a _linked list_ consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file `lists.h` is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file `_putchar.c` is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file `0-print_list.c` is a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

The file `1-list_len.c` is a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

The file `2-add_node.c` is a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

The file `3-add_node_end.c` is a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

The file `4-free_list.c` is a function that frees a list_t list.

The file `100-first.c` is a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

The file `101-hello_holberton.asm` is a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
