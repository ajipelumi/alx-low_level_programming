Nesting of loops is the feature in C that allows the looping of statements inside another loop. 
Any number of loops can be defined inside another loop, i.e., there is no restriction for defining any number of loops. 
The nesting level can be defined at n times. 
You can define any type of loop inside another loop; for example, you can define 'while' loop inside a 'for' loop.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file main.h is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file _putchar.c is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file 0-putchar.c is a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

The file 1-alphabet.c is a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

The file 2-print_alphabet_x10.c is a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

The file 3-islower.c is a function that checks for lowercase character.

The file 4-isalpha.c is a function that checks for alphabetic character.

The file 5-sign.c is a function that prints the sign of a number.

The file 6-abs.c is a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

The file 7-print_last_digit.c is a function that prints the last digit of a number.

The file 8-24_hours.c is a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

The file 9-times_table.c is a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

The file 10-add.c is a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

The file 11-print_to_98.c is a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

The file 100-times_table.c is a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.

The file 101-natural.c is a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

The file 102-fibonacci.c is a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

The file 103-fibonacci.c is a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line.
