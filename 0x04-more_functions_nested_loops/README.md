Nesting of loops is the feature in C that allows the looping of statements inside another loop. Any number of loops can be defined inside another loop, i.e., there is no restriction for defining any number of loops. The nesting level can be defined at n times. You can define any type of loop inside another loop; for example, you can define 'while' loop inside a 'for' loop.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file main.h is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file _putchar.c is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file 0-isupper.c is a function that checks for uppercase character.

The file 1-isdigit.c is a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

The file 2-mul.c is a function that multiplies two integers.

The file 3-print_numbers.c is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

The file 4-print_most_numbers.c is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

The file 5-more_numbers.c is a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

The file 6-print_line.c is a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

The file 7-print_diagonal.c is a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

The file 8-print_square.c is a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

The file 9-fizz_buzz.c is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line.

The file 10-print_triangle.c is a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
