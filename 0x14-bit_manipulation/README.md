**Bit Manipulation** is a technique used in a variety of problems to get the solution in an optimized way. It is all about Bitwise Operators which directly works upon binary numbers or bits of numbers that help the implementation fast. Below are the **Bitwise Operators** that are used:

- Bitwise AND (&)
- Bitwise OR (|)
- Bitwise XOR (^)
- Bitwise NOT (~)
- Left Shift (<<)
- Right Shift (>>)

Bitwise operators are good for saving space and sometimes to cleverly remove dependencies.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file `main.h` is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file `_putchar.c` is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file `0-binary_to_uint.c` is a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

The file `1-print_binary.c` is a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

The file `2-get_bit.c` is a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

The file `3-set_bit.c` is a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

The file `4-clear_bit.c` is a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

The file `5-flip_bits.c` is a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

The file `100-get_endianness.c` is a function that checks the endianness.

The file `101-password` is a function that finds the password for `crackme` file.
