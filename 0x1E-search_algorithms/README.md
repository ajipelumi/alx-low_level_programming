A **search algorithm** is a process or a set of steps used to find a solution to a problem by systematically searching through a large space of possible solutions.

A **linear search**, also known as a sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that traverses a list or an array of elements one by one, checking each element for the target value until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.
The time complexity of a linear search is `O(n)`, where n is the number of elements in the list.

A **binary search**, also known as a logarithmic search, is a search algorithm that works on sorted lists or arrays.
It starts by comparing the target value with the middle element of the list.
If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the list; otherwise, it continues in the upper half.
This process is repeated until the target value is found or the search space is empty. The time complexity of a binary search is `O(log n)`, where n is the number of elements in the list.
