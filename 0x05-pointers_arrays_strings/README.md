A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file main.h is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file _putchar.c is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file 0-reset_to_98.c is a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

The file 1-swap.c is a function that swaps the values of two integers.

The file 2-strlen.c is a function that returns the length of a string.

The file 3-puts.c is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

The file 4-print_rev.c is a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

The file 5-rev_string.c is a function that reverses a string.

The file 6-puts2.c is a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

The file 7-puts_half.c is a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

The file 8-print_array.c is a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

The file 9-strcpy.c is a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

The file 100-atoi.c is a function that convert a string to an integer.
