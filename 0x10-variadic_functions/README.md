**Variadic functions** are functions that can take a variable number of arguments.
A variadic function adds flexibility to the program. It takes one fixed argument and then any number
of arguments can be passed. The variadic function consists of at least one fixed variable and then an `ellipsis(...)` as the last parameter.

Values of the passed arguments can be accessed through the header file named `stdarg.h`.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file variadic_functions.h is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file _putchar.c is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file 0-sum_them_all.c is a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

The file 1-print_numbers.c is a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

The file 2-print_strings.c is a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

The file 3-print_all.c is a function that prints anything.
