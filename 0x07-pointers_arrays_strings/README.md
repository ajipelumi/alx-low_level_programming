A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.

This README describes what each program is doing;

The file main.h is a local header file that contains function definitions.

The file _putchar.c is a function that allows the usage of _putchar to print.

The file 0-memset.c is a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

The file 1-memcpy.c is a function that copies memory area.

The file 2-strchr.c is a function that locates a character in a string.

The file 3-strspn.c is a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

The file 4-strpbrk.c is a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

The file 5-strstr.c is a function that locates a substring.

The file 7-print_chessboard.c is a function that prints the chessboard.

The file 8-print_diagsums.c is a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

The file 100-set_string.c is a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
